# Premise Split View

Create a split view and insert it anywhere in your WordPress site. This lets you compare two different types of content in an interactive split view. Split views can be dragged to display more of one side than the other.

**Supports** inserting Videos, Images, Shortcodes, even Posts or Pages! You can also change the color of the handle. Check out the [demo](http://plugins.premisewp.com/premise-split-view/).
